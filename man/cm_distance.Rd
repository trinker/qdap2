\usage{
  cm_distance(dataframe, time.var = NULL, parallel = FALSE,
    code.var = "code", causal = FALSE, start.var = "start",
    end.var = "end", mean.digits = 2, sd.digits = 2,
    stan.digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataframe}{A data frame from the cm_x2long family
  (\code{cm_range2long}; \code{cm_df2long};
  \code{cm_time2long}).}

  \item{time.var}{An optional variable to split the
  dataframe by (if you have data that is by various times
  this must be supplied).}

  \item{parallel}{logical.  If TRUE runs the cm_distance on
  multiple cores. This is effective with larger data sets
  but may actually be slower with smaller data sets.}

  \item{code.var}{The name of the code variable column.
  Defaults to "codes" as out putted by x2long family.}

  \item{causal}{logical.  If TRUE measures the distance
  between x and y given that x must proceed y.}

  \item{start.var}{The name of the start variable column.
  Defaults to "start" as out putted by x2long family.}

  \item{end.var}{The name of the end variable column.
  Defaults to "end" as out putted by x2long family.}

  \item{mean.digits}{The number of digits to be displayed
  in the mean matrix.}

  \item{sd.digits}{The number of digits to be displayed in
  the sd (standard deviation) matrix.}

  \item{stan.digits}{The number of digits to use in the
  standardized mean difference matrix.}
}
\value{
  An object of the class cm.dist.  This is a list of n
  lists with the following components per each list
  (time.var): \item{mean}{A distance matrix of average
  distances between codes} \item{sd}{A matrix of standard
  deviations of distances between codes} \item{n}{A matrix
  of counts of distances between codes} \item{combined}{A
  matrix of combined mean, sd and n of distances between
  codes} \item{standardized}{A matrix of standardized
  values of distances between codes.  The closer a value is
  to zero the closer two codes relate.}
}
\description{
  Generate distance measures to ascertain a mean distance
  measure between codes.

\usage{
  question_type(text.var, grouping.var = NULL,
    neg.cont = FALSE, percent = TRUE, zero.replace = 0,
    digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{text.var}{The text variable}

  \item{grouping.var}{The grouping variables.  Default NULL
  generates one output for all text.  Also takes a single
  grouping variable or a list of 1 or more grouping
  variables.}

  \item{neg.cont}{logical.  IF TRUE provides separate
  counts for the negative contraction forms of the
  interrogative words.}

  \item{percent}{logical.  If TRUE output given as percent.
  If FALSE the output is proportion.}

  \item{zero.replace}{Value to replace 0 values with.}

  \item{digits}{Integer; number of decimal places to round
  when printing.}
}
\value{
  Returns a list of: \item{raw}{A dataframe of the
  questions used in the transcript and their type.}
  \item{count}{A dataframe of total questions
  (\code{tot.quest}) and counts of question types (initial
  interrogative word) by grouping variable(s).}
  \item{rnp}{Dataframe of the frequency and proportions of
  question types by grouping variable.} \item{missing}{The
  row numbers of the missing data (excluded from
  analysis).} \item{percent}{The value of percent used for
  plotting purposes.} \item{zero.replace}{The value of
  zero.replace used for plotting purposes.}
}

\details{
  The algorithm searches for the following interrogative
  words (and optionally, their negative contraction form as
  well):

  1) whose 2) whom 3) who 4) where 5) what 6) which 7) why
  8) when 9) were 10) was 11) does 12) did 13) do 14) is
  15) are 16) will 17) how 18) should 19) could 20) would
  21) shall 22) may 23) might 24) must 25) can 26) has 27)
  have 28) had 29) ok 30) right 31) correct 32) implied
  do/does

  The interrogative word that is found first (with the
  exception of "ok", "right" and "correct") in the question
  determines the sentence type. "ok", "right" and "correct"
  sentence types are determined if the sentence is a
  question with no other interrogative words found and
  "ok", "right" or "correct" is the last word of the
  sentence.  Those interrogative sentences beginning with
  the word "you" are categorized as implying do or does
  question type, though the use of do/does is not explicit.
  Those with undetermined sentence type are labeled
  unknown.

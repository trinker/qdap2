\title{qdap: Quantitative Discourse Analysis Package}
\description{
  This package automates many of the tasks associated with
  quantitative discourse analysis of transcripts containing
  discourse.  The package provides parsing tools for
  preparing transcript data, coding tools and analysis
  tools for richer understanding of the data.  Many
  functions allow the user to aggregate data by any number
  of grouping variables, providing analysis and seamless
  integration with other R packages which enable higher
  level analysis and visualization of text.  This empowers
  the researcher with more flexible, efficient and targeted
  methods and tools.

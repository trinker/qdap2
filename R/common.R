#' Find Common Words Between Groups
#' 
#' Find common words between grouping variables (e.g. people).
#' 
#' @param word.list A list of names character vectors.
#' @param overlap Minimum/exact amount of overlap.
#' @param equal.or A character vector of c(\code{"equal"}, \code{"greater"}, 
#' \code{"more"}, \code{"less"}).
#' @param \dots In lieu of word.list the user may input n number of character 
#' vectors.
#' @rdname common
#' @return Returns a dataframe of all words that match the criteria set by 
#' \code{overlap} and \code{equal.or}.
